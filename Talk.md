**Why Interviews:**

- Lots of applicants → Need more differentiation.
    - Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial already have more differentiation
    - Oxford: MAT
    - Cambridge: STEP/TSA/Test at Interview.
    - Imperial: Used to be just steeper offers, now they also use the MAT.
- The teaching style.
    - Oxford and Cambridge are some of the only establishments that use the tutorial or supervision system in teaching
        - 2-6, hour long tutorials a week.
        - 1-1, or small groups, with a tutor, discussing problems.
        - Interviews simulate this environment.

**Interview format:**

- 2 interviewers
    - One conducting the interview
        - A tutor/lecturer
    - One (mostly) taking notes
        - Another tutor
        - Graduate student

    - You may be given some problems to work on beforehand.

**Interview tips:**

- Know your personal statement!
    - Actually read the books you say you have.
    - You may be asked about them, to ease you in.
    - If you don’t have an answer here, it seems suspicious (because it is).
- Appear interested and engaged
- The tutor is on your side
    - They are trying to get the best out of you
- Vocalise your thoughts
    - The tutor is looking at your thought process.
    - If you are stuck, don’t be silent, you may be on the right track and your interviewer may be able to help you.
- If the question is very general, see if you can split it up into small, concrete examples, and get a more general solution from there.
- Don’t worry if you don’t finish the problem
